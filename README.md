# LameGallery0.1

This is a tiny digital gallery powered by esp8266. User can upload up to (only) 4 images using wifi. This project is made as birthday gift for someone special.

For now I'm dumping everything here as it is, soon I'll write a better README and do some code clean-up.

This is just a prototype. Now I need make a proper PCB and a 3D printed enclosure.
